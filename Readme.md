## G2T3 Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction using Supervised Learning Techniques
***
You can find a report about our solution in the same folder named "DM_G2T3_Final Report". We have included our final presentation slides named "DM_G2T3_Presentation".

To know more about this challenge hosted by CrowdAI, you can access the following link:
*  https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge

To reproduce, these are the following steps:

1. Download the dataset from the CrowdAI website. The link can be found at the second cell of the ipynb file "Spotify_Skip_Prediction_(Final).ipynb".

2. Import your downloaded dataset into the notebook.

3. Install the relevant libraries required in the "requirements.txt" file.

4. Perform pre-processing of data under the EDA heading.

5. Run respective models and evaluate their performance.

#### For steps 3-5, it is done within the ipynb file.
